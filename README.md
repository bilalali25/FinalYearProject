# FinalYearProject

This repository hosts my Final Year Project (FYP) at City University of Hong Kong, Department of Mechanical Engineering, completed on April 24, 2025, under Dr. Zhao Shijun's supervision. The project investigates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for predicting stacking fault energy (SFE) in NiCoCr medium-entropy alloys, aiming to provide a computationally efficient alternative to traditional methods like DFT and MD. I generated a dataset of 3,000 atomic configurations (3,600 atoms each, 33.33% Ni, Co, Cr) using LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulations, focusing on a subset of 400 structures for training and testing. Two GNN models were developed: ThermoGNN (with 3 GAT layers, 4 attention heads, and a predictor MLP) and CGCNN (with 6 convolutional layers). I conducted experiments on feature selection (e.g., Atomic Number, SGTE Lattice Stability Energy) and hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, dropout). Both models showed limited predictive accuracy, with challenges stemming from the dataset's fixed composition, small size, and insufficient feature engineering, as detailed in the report's results and analysis sections.
